<h1>Pomme-plan üçÖ</h1>
<p>Pomme plan is a planner with multiple study and focus features. Mostly done as a small project for myself to develop my skills as a programmer. As well as something I personally need for my everyday. </p>

For now, the contents will be the following:
- 
- Make a to-do list
- Work on figuring out multiple ways to organize tasks
- Color coded by importance -> Take scrum backlog as reference
- Find which programming language is the best for this project, possibly learn a new one...
- Pomodoro timer
- Make many things windowed
